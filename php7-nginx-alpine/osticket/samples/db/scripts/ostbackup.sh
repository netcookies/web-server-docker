#
# Bash script for creating backups of OSticket.
# Usage: ./ostbackup.sh 
# 
#Based upon https://github.com/DecaTec/Nextcloud-Backup-Restore

#
# IMPORTANT
# You have to customize this script (directories, users, etc.) for your actual environment.
# All entries which need to be customized are tagged with "TODO".
#
# OPTIONALLY
# You can set this script to perform backups only during office hours 
# (f.i. when executing backup every hour, to prevent backups when nothing really changes to your data)
# To do so edit section "WORKING HOURS"
#

# Variables
currentDate=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
# TODO: The directory where you store the OSticket backups
backupMainDir="/db"
# The actual directory of the current backup - this is is subdirectory of the main directory above with a timestamp
backupdir="${backupMainDir}/${currentDate}/"
# TODO: The directory of your OSticket installation (this is a directory under your web root)
osticketFileDir="/usr/html"
# TODO: If you have a separate attachment directory uncomment this line as well as the actual section to restore this directory below
#osticketDataDir="/var/OSattachments" 
# TODO: Your OSticket database address
dbAddr="db"
# TODO: Your OSticket database name

# TODO: Your OSticket database user
dbUser="osticket"
# TODO: The password of the OSticket database user

# TODO: Your web server user
webserverUser="nginx"
webserverGrp="www-data"
# TODO: The maximum number of backups to keep (when set to 0, all backups are kept)

# File names for backup files
# If you prefer other file names, you'll also have to change the OSticket.sh script.
